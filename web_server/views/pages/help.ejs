        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Marinus is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinus_of_Tyre">Marinus of Tyre (AD
                70â€“130)</a>. Marinus
            was the first cartographer to use longitude and latitude on maps (although his meridians were not placed
            where ours are today).
            He introduced equirectangular projection which is how you get a spherical planet on a flat map. Marinus was
            also able to
            project the size of equator within 17% which wasn't bad given his time period. The Antartic owes its name to
            him. Most
            importantly, Ptolemy's <i>Geography</i>, which is the foundational reference of modern geography, was based
            on Marinus' work in
            cartography. Since this tool aims to map an organization's network, it is named after Marinus of Tyre.</p>

        <p>Marinus tries to combine data from widely different sources that don't always make obvious sense when put
            together. In that
            spirit, the Satyrus Marinus was chosen as the icon for the tool because it is part man, part goat, and part
            fish.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Marinus is a consolidator of information from several online archives including VirusTotal, the Open Data
            project, and Whois
            records. The goal is to make it easier to review and consolidate infomration about networks. By comparing
            internal and external
            sources, Marinus can help identify abandoned domains, identify our network scope, and other useful tasks.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, Marinus is not a real-time system. It updates from repositories about once a week. There are a few
            things that
            Marinus can do real time such as a whois lookup but those are the exception. Marinus is also not a
            historical record. If
            something was recorded by a source one week and it wasn't recorded the following week, then it is deleted
            from the database.
            Several of the sources that I pull from are not "on demand". Therefore, if they didn't release an update
            this week, then the
            database won't be updated.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>Key Terminology</h3>
        <p><b>Root Domain:</b> Marinus uses "Root Domain" to refer to things like "example.com" or "example.org". The
            domain
            "images.example.org" would not be considered a fully qualified domain name since it includes a sub-domain.
        </p>
        <p><b>CIDR</b> A CIDR refers to a range of IP addresses described using the "/##" notation. For instance, it
            might refer to the
            Class C range "250.250.16.0/24". </p>
        <p><b>Zone:</b> The term zone typically refers to a grouping of data either by the First Level Domain ("Zone")
            or the CIDR
            ("IP Zone").</p>

        <br />
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>The Navigation in the header is grouped into types of searches. These include:</p>
        <p><b>Host Details:</b> This section is for when you are searching for something specific such as a specific
            domain or IP
            Address.</p>
        <p><b>Meta Search:</b> This section is for when you are trying to search for hosts based on specific properties
            such as Port or
            HTTP headers. The Meta search provides the lists of all the IPs and root domains that are tracked by
            Marinus. Therefore,if you don't
            know exactly what you need, then this is a good place to start.</p>
        <p><b>Reports:</b> This section includes reports on potential security issues such as internal data that is
            externally viewable,
            TLS issues, and similar findings.</p>
        <p><b>User:</b> Underneath the user icon, you can find out details about your account and access administrative
            features if you have
            proper permissions.</p>
        <p><b>Help:</b> You are looking at it.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Graphs</h3>
        <p>Marinus uses the d3.js library to create graphs of networks and certificate relationships. The legend on the
            left hand side groups
            together similar nodes by color. By moving the mouse over the boxes in the legend, you will be able to
            highlight the related nodes.
            You can use the search at the top of the graph to identify nodes with specific strings. IP addresses within
            the Azure or AWS clouds
            will all be grouped together. IP addresses that are not a part of those two clouds are grouped together by
            their Class C. The legend
            is also useful for getting a quick summary of the related third-party domains.</p>
        <p>For complex networks, the graph will often exceed the initial visible viewing area. By using the scroll
            functionality on
            your mouse or the two finger swipe on a Mac, then the map can be zoomed in and out. It is also possible to
            drag nodes
            across the screen. Unfortunately, there is an upper limit on the size of graphs that the browser can render
            and it will start
            to struggle if there are thousands of nodes.</p>
        <p>Clicking on nodes will provide mode detailed information in a pop up that appears below. Clicking the "X" on
            the right hand side will close the pop up. In addition, mousing over the square boxes in the legend will
            highlight all the
            nodes in that group.</p>
        </br>

        <h3>Bookmarking</h3>
        <p>The pages under the "Host" pull down menu support a "search" parameter in the URL that can be bookmarked by
            your web
            browser.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>Some pages are currently slow to load due to complex database queries and the data may incrementally populate
            in the web
            page over time. This is a known issue and it will hopefully be improved going forward.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Leveraging the API</h3>
        <p>Marinus is completely API driven. This design choice is meant to empower people to create their own reports
            based on the
            data. Each account has an "apiKey" generated so that the user can create utilities based on Marinus data.
            You can provide the
            "apiKey" via GET parameters in the URL for authentication (or the body if you are doing a post). It is also
            possible to provide
            the key as an Header: x-api-key . The latter is preferred since prevents the API key from being recorded in
            the access logs.
        </p>
        <p>Details regarding the Marinus API is available in Swagger format at <a href="/docs/">/docs</a>.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Zone Status</h3>
        <p>If you have been granted data admin rights, then you can change the status and add notes to zones. There are
            three statuses
            for a zone:</p>
        <b>Confirmed:</b> This has been reviewed by a human and confirmed to be factual data about the
        organization.<br />
        <b>Unconfirmed:</b> Marinus has picked up this data in its search but it has never been reviewed by a human.
        Marinus has a low
        false positive rate but the rate is not zero. Therefore, it is listed as unconfirmed.<br />
        <b>False Positive:</b> A human has reviewed this and determined that this piece of data is a false positive.
        While it may have
        been related to the organization at some point, is no longer related to the organization.<br />
        <b>Expired:</b> This was registered to the organization at one time but has not been renewed.<br />
        <br />

        <h3>Zone Notes</h3>
        <p>Marinus supports the capability to tag a zone with a note. These notes are not intended to be multi-paragraph
            descriptions
            of everything regarding the zone. Instead, these should be simple tags that are consistently applied. If
            they are simple tags,
            then it is possible to search based on tags. Ideally, the tags would be things like the product name,
            "Akamai", etc.</p>
        <p><b>Warning:</b> Delete functionality is not currently supported. This must be done manually by the database
            administrator.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p>Marinus has the ability to pull data from various external sources of information such as Censys, Rapid7 Open
            Data, Whois
            records, Common Crawl, and VirusTotal. If configured, it can also pull from private sources such as
            Infoblox, AWS Route53,
            Azure DNS, and UltraDNS services. The data sources are chosen by the administrator of the tool.</p>
